The President asked me to personally reach out to you because he noticed your name was missing from the most recent list of entries to win the hand-signed Make America Great Again hat. I'm giving him an updated list tonight and want to make sure he sees your name at the very top. Claim your free entry now for this beautiful Make America Great Again hat and remember, if you win, President Trump will hand deliver it to you at an upcoming rally.\n",

I would shut it down. No miracle is coming. If I were president today, I would roll back the reopenings in a number of places. Biden wants to surrender our country to the virus. He wants to surrender our families to the pilot left-wing mob. And he wants to surrender our jobs to China. I would shut it down. I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message.

            "17   Why in this nation do black Americans wake up knowing that they can lose their lives in the course of just living their life? Part of the point of freedom is to be free from brutality, from injustice, from racism and all of its manifestations. We have to let people know that we not only understand their struggle, but they understand the fact that they deserve to be treated with dignity. They've got to know we're listening. Reforming policing in this country means creating a national standard on use of force and conditioning federal funds for police departments on adoption of that standard. It's about reining in qualified immunity. We hold police officers accountable. We can't turn away. Now is the time for racial justice. I believe with every fiber in my being, we have such an opportunity now to change people's lives for the better.

We cannot and will not walk away from our obligation to at long last face the reckoning on racial justice in this country. As president, that's precisely what I will do. I'm ready to fight for you and for our nation every day.\n",

That bravery lived in each of our hearts. She taught us never to be intimidated by power, wealth, or station. That we could set our own standards based on character alone. She called it the Biden Standard. My mother's creed is the American Creed. For more information, visit www.FEMA.gov\n",
            "23                               I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering loss of a loved one, suffering economic hardship. A country is crying out for leadership, leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together. That's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us. But I promise you this, I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. You know, I've said from the outset of this election that we're in the battle for the soul of this nation. But we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all at stake. We stand together, finally as one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message.\n",

It's where he learned middle class values that stuck with him his entire life. In this crisis, we need a president on the side of workers, not Wall Street. Joe Biden. He'll unite us for a better America.\n",
